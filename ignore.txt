# Ignore-List

# Every probe request will be checked against this list of regular expressions and ignored, if it matches. Please keep in mind, that you are matching
# against a single string per probe request, which can differ relatively to your chosen delimiter (default = \t) and other options. Check the log file for clarity.
# You can use "#" for comments and empty lines for better readability of this file. This file is not parsed during runtime, so the service/script has to be
# restarted to come to effect
